## ABOUT ME💬
Hey there! I'm João Almeida, a tech enthusiast whose passion for computers started back in childhood, when I'd spend hours exploring the digital world from my room. It wasn’t just a phase — it shaped who I am today.

I took my first steps into the tech world studying Technology at university, and although life led me in a different direction for a while, my love for code never wavered. I later found myself collecting and analyzing sports data at Stats Perform, where I earned a reputation for precision and timing. (and quoting The Notorious🥊precision and timing beats speed everytime).

Now, I'm embracing my full stack development journey, where I get to combine the analytical mindset I picked up from sports data with a passion for building intuitive, user-friendly software. I thrive on challenges — debugging code might be the closest thing to a real-life escape room, and I’m here for it.
